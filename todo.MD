# Event Management System â€“ MVP & Development Roadmap

## MVP Goal:
Build a basic Django web application where users can:
- Register with role choice: visitor or creator, and log in / log out

- Create events with basic details (creators)
- View a list of their own events with all details (creators)
- Cancel their own events with all its visitors registrations (creators)

- Browse published (and search bu status) events (visitors)
- View all event details with reg. button or reg. status (visitors)
- Register as participants for events and cancellation (visitors)

- Use PostgreSQL as the database
- Wrap into Docker container in the end of MVP part
